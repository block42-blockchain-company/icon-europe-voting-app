-excerpts from https://www.icondev.io/docs/writing-score:
<<DictDB does not maintain order, whereas ArrayDB, which supports length and iterator, maintains order.>>

<<VarDB, DictDB, and ArrayDB are utility classes wrapping the state database.
A key can be numbers or characters, and value_type can be int, str, bytes and Address.
If the key does not exist, the wrapping classes return the zero value of value_type, which is 0 for int, "" for str, and None for bytes or Address.>>
